## Deferred Stories from Epic 3

### Story 3.0: Organization/Workspace System

**Deferred from Epic 3** on 2025-10-22 by PO decision.

**Rationale for Deferral:**
- Not required for AI features to function
- Current user system (`getAllUsers()`) works for MVP and small-medium teams
- Reduces Epic 3 complexity and timeline
- Better suited for Epic 4 which can focus on scaling infrastructure

**Original Story Description:**

As a **user**,
I want **to belong to an organization/workspace where I can message other members**,
so that **I only see relevant contacts and can participate in team-based messaging at scale**.

**Key Acceptance Criteria:**
1. `Organization` entity created with: id, name, memberIds, createdAt, settings
2. User entity updated with `organizationIds: [String]` field (users can belong to multiple orgs)
3. Update `getAllUsers()` â†’ `getUsersInOrganization(organizationId: String)` in UserRepository
4. Update `getOrCreateConversation()` to validate participants in same organization
5. Organization selection UI for users in multiple organizations (simple dropdown/picker)
6. Default organization auto-created for existing users (migration script)
7. Admin users can invite new users to organization (email invitation)
8. Organization settings: name, member management, permissions
9. Firestore security rules updated: Users can only query users in their organization(s)
10. Performance: User queries scoped to organization (< 100ms for 1000+ member orgs)
11. Conversation list filtered to conversations within current organization
12. Unit tests for organization-based user filtering
13. Integration test: User A in Org 1 cannot message User B in Org 2
14. Migration: Existing users assigned to "Default Organization"
15. Error handling: User without organization shown onboarding flow

**Complexity:** High
**Estimated Time:** 16 hours
**Risk:** Medium (data migration, schema changes)
