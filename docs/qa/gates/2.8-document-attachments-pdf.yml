# Review Notes
review_notes: |
  ✅ UPDATED 2025-10-22 22:00 - All critical issues resolved by QA.

  This is an excellent implementation that successfully reused 90% of Story 2.7's
  infrastructure as planned. The developer demonstrated strong architectural
  understanding and comprehensive testing practices.

  QA review identified two critical issues:
  1. Security gap: storage.rules missing MIME type validation (AC 8)
  2. Force unwrap risk in QuickLookPreview

  Both issues were fixed by QA during review:
  - ✅ MIME type validation added to storage.rules (line 33)
  - ✅ Force unwrap replaced with guard statement (QuickLookPreview:47-53)

  All 18 unit tests pass after fixes, and Epic 2 regression suite (45 tests) shows
  zero regressions. The implementation follows Clean Architecture principles with
  proper protocol abstractions and dependency injection.

  Gate upgraded from CONCERNS to PASS after fixes applied. Story ready for Done
  pending storage rules deployment.

# Recommended Next Steps
next_steps:
  - "Deploy storage rules to dev: `firebase deploy --only storage:rules --project messageai-dev`"
  - "Mark story as Done"
  - "Consider adding integration test when emulator setup is available (Post-MVP)"
