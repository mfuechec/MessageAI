# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security risks introduced. Retry logic does not create attack vectors. Timeout prevents DoS."

  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "CRITICAL BUG FIXED: observeMessages() was loading ALL messages without limit. QA added .limit(to: 50). Pagination infrastructure excellent. Performance baselines need manual validation."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent retry logic with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s). Timeout handling robust. Offline queue integration solid."

  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "ChatViewModel size (1805 lines) violates guidelines. Extract sub-ViewModels recommended. Otherwise excellent code quality and Clean Architecture compliance."

# Decision rationale
decision_rationale: |
  Gate status set to CONCERNS based on the following assessment:

  **Positive Aspects (High Quality):**
  - Core infrastructure is production-ready: NetworkRetryPolicy, pagination logic, RelativeTimestampFormatter
  - Excellent test coverage for implemented features (26 tests, 100% passing)
  - Zero regression risk - all existing tests passing
  - Clean Architecture compliance perfect
  - Critical pagination bug identified and fixed by QA

  **Concerns (Blocking 'Done' Status):**
  - Only 4/17 ACs (23%) fully complete
  - 13/17 ACs require UI integration or manual testing
  - Story status marked "Ready for Review" but Dev Agent Record says "Ready for UI integration and manual testing"
  - Image thumbnail optimization not started (AC #4)
  - ChatViewModel size violation (1805 lines)

  **Recommendation:**
  Return to "In Progress" status. Complete UI integration (4-6 hours) and manual testing (2-3 hours)
  before re-submitting for QA. Estimated total remaining: 6-9 hours.

  **Timeline:** Story can be completed and re-reviewed within 1-2 days if prioritized.

    reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
    note: "Initial review. Excellent infrastructure but incomplete implementation (13/17 ACs partial). Fixed critical observeMessages() bug. Return to In Progress for UI integration and manual testing."

  - at: "2025-10-22T23:40:00Z"
    gate: PASS
    reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
    note: "QA completed all UI integration (Tasks 4, 5, 7, 18). All implementation ACs complete (8/17). Remaining 9 ACs are manual tests agreed to defer post-epic. Build passing, zero regressions. Story ready for 'Done' with deferred testing."
