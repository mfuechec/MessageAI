  clean_architecture: PASS
  notes: |
    - Domain layer remains pure Swift (no Firebase imports)
    - Repository abstractions maintained (StorageRepositoryProtocol)
    - Dependency injection via DIContainer
    - ViewModels use @MainActor for concurrency safety
    - Proper separation: Utils (Presentation), Repositories (Data), Entities (Domain)

  dependency_rules: PASS
  notes: |
    - All dependencies point inward (Presentation → Domain ← Data)
    - No direct Firebase references in ViewModels
    - StorageRepository injected via protocol
    - ImageCompressor and ImageCacheManager properly in Presentation/Utils layer

  coding_standards: PASS
  notes: |
    - Modern Swift async/await throughout
    - No force unwrapping (!) in production code
    - Guard statements for early returns
    - Proper struct vs class usage (utilities as enums)
    - SwiftUI @Published bindings for reactive UI

  file_organization: PASS
  notes: |
    - New files in correct locations (Utils, Components, Repositories)
    - Test files mirror implementation structure
    - Naming conventions followed (PascalCase types, camelCase functions)

# Final assessment
final_notes: |
  Story 2.7 demonstrates excellent implementation quality with all acceptance criteria met.
  The code follows established architectural patterns from previous stories and maintains
  clean separation of concerns. Security is properly enforced at the Firebase level.

  The offline queue implementation with file system storage is particularly well-designed,
  avoiding UserDefaults overflow issues and enabling reliable retry after app restart.

  Minor improvement opportunities identified are all low-severity and appropriate for
  future refactoring. No blockers present.

  **Recommended Status: Ready for Done**
