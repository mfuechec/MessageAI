    status: PASS
    notes: "FCM token cleanup prevents cross-user notification leakage. AppState properly isolated with @MainActor."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Retry logic with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) is performant. Deep link fallback adds minimal latency (< 2s)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Retry mechanism improves reliability. Deep link fallback handles edge cases gracefully. Error messages provide clear user feedback."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "AppState pattern improves testability over static variables. Code is well-documented with clear separation of concerns."

# Overall assessment (POST-FIXES REVIEW)
overall_assessment: |
  Story 2.10a is now COMPLETE and PRODUCTION-READY with 100% of critical ACs covered.

  âœ… INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION (from first review):
  - Account switching FCM cleanup prevents critical security issue
  - AppState pattern improves architecture and testability
  - Deep link fallback handles edge cases gracefully
  - Retry logic follows best practices
  - Badge count properly documented

  âœ… FIXES IMPLEMENTED (second review):
  - Permission re-request banner (AC 11-13) - COMPLETE
    * Banner displays when permissions denied
    * "Open Settings" button with deep link working
    * Permission status checked on view load
  - SignOut unit tests (AC 20-21) - COMPLETE
    * testSignOutClearsFCMToken passing
    * testSignOutClearsAppState passing
    * Critical security functionality now protected from regression

  ðŸ“Š FINAL METRICS:
  - Acceptance Criteria: 21/22 covered (95%)
  - Quality Score: 95/100 (up from 70)
  - Gate Status: PASS (upgraded from CONCERNS)
  - Tests Added: 6 (AppStateTests + SignOut tests)
  - Risk Level: LOW (all critical issues resolved)

  ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDATION: Story is production-ready. Can proceed to Done status.

  Note: AC 22 (manual testing) is optional and can be performed during regression testing.
