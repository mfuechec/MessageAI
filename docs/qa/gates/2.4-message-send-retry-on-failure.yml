# Quality Gate Decision for Story 2.4
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "2.4"
story_title: "Message Send Retry on Failure"
gate: "CONCERNS"
status_reason: "Implementation is production-ready with one critical bug fixed during review, but has minor test coverage gaps (missing performance test for AC #8, missing integration test for AC #12). Functionality is complete and robust."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
