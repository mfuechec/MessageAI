# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Clean Architecture Foundation

## Status

**Ready for Review**

---

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a well-structured Xcode project with Clean Architecture folders and dependency injection,  
**so that** the codebase is maintainable, testable, and follows best practices from day one.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Xcode project created with Swift 5.9+ targeting iOS 15+
2. Folder structure implements Clean Architecture layers:
   - `App/` (AppDelegate, SceneDelegate, DIContainer)
   - `Domain/Entities/` (pure Swift models)
   - `Domain/UseCases/` (business logic protocols)
   - `Domain/Repositories/` (repository protocols)
   - `Data/Repositories/` (concrete implementations)
   - `Data/Network/` (service layer)
   - `Presentation/ViewModels/` (view models)
   - `Presentation/Views/` (SwiftUI views)
   - `Tests/` (unit and integration tests)
3. DIContainer created with dependency injection setup
4. Swift Package Manager configured as dependency manager
5. `.gitignore` configured for Xcode projects
6. Git repository initialized with initial commit
7. Dark mode support enabled in project settings
8. Portrait orientation locked in project configuration
9. Basic `README.md` created documenting project structure
10. Project builds successfully on simulator and physical device

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Overview

This story establishes the foundation for the entire iOS application using **Clean Architecture with MVVM pattern**. The architecture enforces strict separation of concerns across layers to achieve high testability and maintainability.

**[Source: docs/architecture/ios-app-architecture.md#layer-structure]**

### Folder Structure Details

The complete folder structure to create (as defined in architecture):

```
MessageAI/
├── App/
│   ├── MessageAIApp.swift          # SwiftUI App entry point
│   └── DIContainer.swift           # Dependency injection container
│
├── Domain/                          # Pure Swift, no external dependencies
│   ├── Entities/                   # (Will be populated in Story 1.3)
│   ├── UseCases/                   # (Will be populated in Story 1.3+)
│   └── Repositories/               # Protocol definitions only (Story 1.3)
│
├── Data/                            # Firebase implementations
│   ├── Repositories/               # (Will be populated in Story 1.4)

│
├── Presentation/
│   ├── ViewModels/                 # (Will be populated starting Story 1.5)
│   ├── Views/                      # (Will be populated starting Story 1.5)
│   └── Components/                 # Reusable UI components
│
└── Resources/
    ├── Assets.xcassets              # Images, colors, icons
    └── Info.plist
```

**[Source: docs/architecture/ios-app-architecture.md#layer-structure]**

### Technology Specifications

- **Language**: Swift 5.9+ (protocol-oriented design, async/await concurrency)
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI (iOS 15+, declarative UI, automatic dark mode)
- **Dependency Management**: Swift Package Manager (native, no CocoaPods/Carthage)
- **Testing**: XCTest (native Apple testing framework)

**[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]**

### Critical Architecture Rules for This Story

1. **Clean Architecture Layers Must Be Separate**: 
   - Domain layer = pure Swift (no external dependencies, no UIKit/SwiftUI imports)
   - Data layer = Firebase implementations
   - Presentation layer = SwiftUI views and ViewModels
   
   **[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]**

2. **Dependency Injection Pattern**:
   - DIContainer will provide factory methods for creating ViewModels
   - ViewModels receive dependencies through initializers (never create own dependencies)
   
   **[Source: docs/architecture/ios-app-architecture.md#dependency-injection]**

3. **Project Settings**:
   - Portrait orientation only (locked in project settings)
   - Dark mode enabled by default
   - iOS 15+ minimum deployment target
   
   **[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#key-technology-decisions]**

### Dependency Injection Container Pattern

In this story, create a basic DIContainer structure. Future stories will populate it with factory methods:

```swift
// Example structure to implement (from architecture)
class DIContainer {
    // Singletons (will be added in Story 1.2)
    // private let firebaseService: FirebaseService
    
    // Repositories (will be added in Story 1.4)
    // private lazy var authRepository: AuthRepositoryProtocol = ...
    
    init() {
        // Initialize core services in future stories
    }
    
    // Factory methods (will be added as needed in future stories)
    // func makeAuthViewModel() -> AuthViewModel { ... }
}
```

**[Source: docs/architecture/ios-app-architecture.md#dependency-injection]**

### Git Configuration

Standard Xcode `.gitignore` must exclude:
- Build artifacts (`build/`, `DerivedData/`)
- User-specific files (`xcuserdata/`, `*.xcuserstate`)
- Swift Package Manager build files (`.build/`, `Packages/`)
- Firebase configuration files (`GoogleService-Info.plist` - will be added in Story 1.2)

**[Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow-deployment.md#local-development-setup]**

### README Documentation Requirements

The README.md should provide:
- Project name and purpose
- Architecture explanation (Clean Architecture + MVVM)
- Folder structure with layer descriptions
- Setup instructions (placeholder for now, Firebase setup comes in Story 1.2)
- Tech stack summary

**[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, ios-app-architecture.md]**

## Testing

### Test Requirements for This Story

**Unit Tests**: Not required for this story (no business logic yet)

**Integration Tests**: Not required for this story (no integrations yet)

**Manual Validation Required**:
1. Project builds successfully (`Cmd+B`)
2. App launches on simulator showing default SwiftUI view
3. Folder structure visible in Xcode Project Navigator
4. Dark mode enabled (test by switching simulator appearance)
5. Portrait orientation locked (simulator rotation test)
6. Git repository initialized with clean commit history

### Test Framework Setup

Full test framework setup will occur in **Story 1.10**. For now, Xcode automatically creates a test target with the project.

**Test Structure** (to be populated in Story 1.10):
```
MessageAITests/
├── Domain/
│   ├── UseCases/
│   └── Entities/
├── Data/
│   └── Repositories/
└── Presentation/
    └── ViewModels/
```

**[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-structure]**

### Testing Standards to Follow (Future Stories)

- **Coverage Goal**: 70%+ for Domain and Data layers, 75%+ for ViewModels
- **Framework**: XCTest (native Apple framework)
- **Mocking Strategy**: Protocol-based mocks for repositories
- **Test Pyramid**: 80% unit tests, 15% integration, 5% E2E

**[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-coverage-goals]**
