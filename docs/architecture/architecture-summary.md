# Architecture Summary

**MessageAI Architecture at a Glance:**

- **Platform:** iOS 15+ native app with SwiftUI + Firebase serverless backend
- **Architecture Pattern:** Clean Architecture (MVVM) with repository abstraction
- **Real-Time:** Firestore snapshot listeners (< 500ms latency)
- **Offline-First:** Full functionality offline with automatic sync
- **AI Integration:** Server-side Cloud Functions calling OpenAI GPT-4
- **Testing:** 70%+ code coverage with test-first development
- **Deployment:** TestFlight for beta, manual CI/CD for MVP

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Clean Architecture** enables 70%+ test coverage through repository mocking
2. **Firebase Serverless** eliminates infrastructure management for 7-day sprint
3. **iOS-only** achieves production quality on one platform over mediocre multi-platform
4. **Firestore over Realtime Database** for superior querying and offline caching
5. **Aggressive AI caching** reduces costs by 70%+ through 24-hour result expiration

**Risk Mitigations Implemented:**

- Message status race conditions → `statusUpdatedAt` timestamp
- Unbounded array growth → Capped at 10 edit history, read count summary
- Missing AI metadata → Added to Conversation model for efficient queries
- No timezone info → Added `timezone`/`locale` to User model
- Cache invalidation complexity → Simplified with `latestMessageId` matching
- Firestore index requirements → Predefined in `firestore.indexes.json`
- Data migration → Schema versioning on all models

**Next Steps for Development:**

1. **Shard Architecture Document** → Create focused files per epic
2. **Create Coding Standards Files** → `.cursor/rules/swift-standards.md`
3. **Begin Epic 1 Development** → Foundation & Core Messaging
4. **Deploy Firestore Indexes** → `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`
5. **Set Up Test Framework** → Mock repositories and test harness

**Architecture Document Complete!** ✅

This architecture provides a comprehensive blueprint for building MessageAI from foundation through advanced AI features. All major decisions are documented, risks are identified and mitigated, and the development team (human + AI agents) has clear guidance for implementation.

**Document Status:** Ready for Epic 1 development kickoff.
