# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Deliver production-quality messaging infrastructure meeting all Gauntlet MVP requirements with zero message loss and real-time synchronization across devices
- Build AI-powered features that solve real pain points for remote team professionals (thread overload, missed important messages, context switching)
- Implement testable Clean Architecture enabling rapid iteration, comprehensive test coverage, and maintainable codebase
- Identify and mitigate technical risks through test-first development and prototype validation before feature implementation
- Create a B2B-focused product with team subscription potential targeting distributed engineering teams
- Successfully complete Gauntlet AI bootcamp final project showcasing end-to-end mobile AI development with modern iOS patterns

## Background Context

Remote team professionals—software engineers, designers, and PMs in distributed teams—are drowning in message threads across multiple platforms. Critical decisions get buried in conversations, action items are forgotten, and constant context-switching destroys productivity. Existing solutions like Slack and Teams add features but don't fundamentally solve the information overload problem.

MessageAI addresses this by combining WhatsApp-level messaging reliability with AI-powered intelligence. The app will help remote teams surface what matters, extract decisions and action items automatically, and proactively assist with coordination. This project follows the "golden path" tech stack (Swift + Firebase) recommended for rapid mobile development, allowing focus on product differentiation through AI features rather than infrastructure complexity.

The MVP is structured in two phases: **Phase 1** focuses on building all required infrastructure and features with functional completeness, while **Phase 2** polishes the infrastructure for optimal message delivery speed and reliability under various network conditions. This approach ensures a solid foundation before layering AI capabilities. Quality is defined quantifiably: zero message loss, real-time delivery between online users, graceful offline/online transitions, and message persistence across app restarts. Testing precedes implementation—comprehensive test suites will be reviewed and approved before feature development begins, ensuring architectural decisions are validated early.
