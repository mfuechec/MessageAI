- **FR20:** The system shall allow users to view their complete chat history while offline using cached data
- **FR21:** The system shall handle poor network conditions (3G, packet loss) gracefully without data loss
- **FR22:** The system shall notify users when connectivity is restored and show count of pending messages ready to send

**AI Features for Remote Team Professional (Post-MVP)**

- **FR23:** The system shall provide thread summarization, condensing long conversations into key points and decisions
- **FR24:** The system shall extract action items from conversations and present them as a structured list with assignees
- **FR25:** The system shall implement smart search allowing users to find messages using natural language queries
- **FR26:** The system shall detect and highlight priority messages requiring user attention or response
- **FR27:** The system shall track decisions made in conversations and provide decision history view
- **FR28:** The system shall implement a proactive assistant that auto-suggests meeting times based on conversation context
- **FR29:** The system shall detect scheduling needs in messages and proactively offer coordination assistance

**User Management**

- **FR30:** The system shall allow users to create accounts with email and password
- **FR31:** The system shall enable users to set and update their profile picture and display name
- **FR32:** The system shall provide a contacts/user search interface to find and start conversations

**Future Considerations (Post-MVP Stretch Goals)**

- **FR33 (Stretch):** The system may integrate with Jira to link conversations with existing tickets and add comments
- **FR34 (Stretch):** The system may allow creation of new Jira tickets directly from conversation context
- **FR35 (Stretch):** The system may provide user blocking and conversation management features
- **FR36 (Stretch):** The system may implement analytics and telemetry for measuring AI feature usage and engagement

## Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance (MVP Phase 2 Focus)**

- **NFR1:** The system shall never lose messages under any network conditions (zero message loss guarantee)
- **NFR2:** The system shall deliver messages to online users within 2 seconds under normal network conditions
- **NFR3:** The system shall handle rapid-fire messaging (20+ messages sent quickly) without performance degradation
- **NFR4:** The system shall load conversation history (last 50 messages) within 1 second on app launch
- **NFR5:** The system shall support conversations with 10,000+ messages without UI performance issues

**Reliability & Availability**

- **NFR6:** The system shall ensure message delivery even if the app crashes mid-send through persistent queuing
- **NFR7:** The system shall gracefully handle Firebase service interruptions with local caching and retry logic
- **NFR8:** The system shall maintain data consistency across multiple devices for the same user account

**Security**

- **NFR9:** The system shall store all Firebase API credentials securely in iOS Keychain, never in source code
- **NFR10:** The system shall use Firebase Security Rules to ensure users can only access their own conversations
- **NFR11:** The system shall encrypt all network communication using HTTPS/TLS via Firebase SDK

**Testability**

- **NFR12:** The system shall implement Clean Architecture (MVVM) enabling unit testing of business logic without UI dependencies
- **NFR13:** The system shall use repository pattern allowing mock implementations for testing without Firebase connections
- **NFR14:** The system shall achieve minimum 70% code coverage for business logic and data layers before feature development proceeds

**Usability**

- **NFR15:** The system shall follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines for native look and feel
- **NFR16:** The system shall use SwiftUI for declarative UI implementation with live preview support
- **NFR17:** The system shall integrate MessageKit for professional chat UI components reducing custom UI development

**Scalability & Cost**

- **NFR18:** The system shall optimize Firebase usage to remain within free tier limits during development and initial testing
- **NFR19:** The system shall implement efficient Firestore queries minimizing read/write operations and costs
- **NFR20:** The system shall use Firebase offline persistence to reduce redundant network requests

**AI Integration**

- **NFR21:** The system shall call AI services (OpenAI/Anthropic) via Firebase Cloud Functions to protect API keys from client exposure
- **NFR22:** The system shall implement caching for AI-generated content (summaries, action items) to minimize redundant LLM calls
