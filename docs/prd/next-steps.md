# Next Steps

## For UX Expert Agent

The UX Expert should refine:
- Detailed UI specifications for all screens
- Interaction patterns and animations
- Accessibility implementation details
- Design system components
- User flow diagrams

## For Architect Agent

The architecture document should detail:

**System Architecture:**
- Clean Architecture (MVVM) layer breakdown with iOS/Swift specifics
- Firebase backend architecture (Firestore, Cloud Functions, FCM, Storage)
- Real-time messaging flow diagrams
- AI service integration patterns
- Offline-first data strategy

**Database Schema:**
- Firestore collections structure (users, conversations, messages, action_items, decisions, ai_cache)
- Security rules design
- Indexing strategy for performance

**Cloud Functions Architecture:**
- Function-by-function breakdown (summarizeThread, extractActionItems, detectPriorityMessages, etc.)
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Caching and cost optimization strategies

**iOS App Architecture:**
- Clean Architecture folder structure details
- Dependency injection strategy
- Repository pattern implementation
- ViewModel patterns for each feature
- MessageKit integration approach

**AI Integration Patterns:**
- LLM prompt engineering guidelines
- Function calling / tool use patterns
- Caching strategies for AI results
- Error handling and fallback patterns

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit testing approach (70%+ coverage)
- Integration testing with Firebase
- UI testing for critical flows
- Manual testing scenarios

**Deployment & DevOps:**
- Firebase project configuration (dev/prod)
- TestFlight deployment process
- Environment variable management
- API key security (Keychain)

## For Development Team (SM → Dev → QA Cycle)

Once architecture is complete:

1. **Shard Documents:** Run `shard-doc` on PRD and Architecture
2. **Epic 1 Sprint:** SM creates stories → Dev implements → QA reviews
3. **Continue through Epic 5:** Repeat cycle for each epic
4. **Final validation:** Complete testing and deploy to TestFlight
5. **Gauntlet submission:** Demo and documentation package

**PRD Complete!** ✅

This Product Requirements Document provides complete specifications for building MessageAI from foundation through advanced AI features. The structured epic approach with detailed stories, acceptance criteria, and quality gates ensures systematic progress toward a production-quality messaging app with intelligent features for remote team professionals.
