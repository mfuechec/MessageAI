# Story Quality Standards & PO Review Criteria

**Pattern Type:** Product Owner Review Process
**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Context:** Story 2.8 Review - Document Attachments (PDF)

## Core Principle

**A production-ready story must be comprehensive, testable, and actionable without requiring developers to hunt for information.**

## 5-Star Story Quality Checklist

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Exceptional Quality (Story 2.8 Standard)

**Story Statement:**
- [ ] Follows "As a [user], I want [feature], so that [value]" format
- [ ] Clear value proposition
- [ ] Aligns with epic goals

**Acceptance Criteria (16 is excellent):**
- [ ] 10-20 comprehensive acceptance criteria
- [ ] All criteria are testable and measurable
- [ ] Covers functional, non-functional, and quality requirements
- [ ] Includes regression testing requirement
- [ ] No ambiguous terms (avoid "should", "might", "usually")
- [ ] Specific numbers: "< 10 seconds", "10MB limit", "within 3 seconds"

**Dependency Management:**
- [ ] Dependencies on previous stories explicitly stated
- [ ] Infrastructure reuse percentage quantified ("90% reuse")
- [ ] Key differences from previous stories documented (table format)
- [ ] Previous story learnings summarized
- [ ] Task 0: "Check Existing Implementation" (avoid duplicate work)

**Technical Guidance:**
- [ ] Dev Notes section with source references
- [ ] Data models specified or referenced
- [ ] API specifications documented
- [ ] Component specifications listed
- [ ] File locations provided (Domain → Data → Presentation)
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] All references properly sourced: `[Source: docs/architecture/...]`

**Task Breakdown:**
- [ ] 15-20 tasks with clear subtasks
- [ ] Tasks map directly to acceptance criteria
- [ ] Critical Task 0: Check existing implementation first
- [ ] Testing tasks included (unit, integration, performance)
- [ ] Manual testing checklist
- [ ] Each task has clear deliverables

**Testing Requirements:**
- [ ] Unit tests specified
- [ ] Integration tests specified
- [ ] Performance tests with benchmarks
- [ ] Regression tests explicitly required
- [ ] Testing commands provided (story/epic/full)
- [ ] 70%+ coverage requirement stated

**Documentation Quality:**
- [ ] All required sections present
- [ ] Code examples where helpful
- [ ] Formatting consistent
- [ ] No broken references
- [ ] Security rules templates included

## Story 2.8 as Gold Standard

Story 2.8 is the **reference standard** for story quality in this project.

### Why Story 2.8 is Exemplary

**1. Comprehensive Acceptance Criteria (16 ACs)**

✅ **Functional:**
- AC 1: Document picker accessible
- AC 5: MessageKit displays document card
- AC 6: QuickLook viewer opens

✅ **Non-Functional:**
- AC 2: 10MB size limit enforcement
- AC 8: Firebase Storage security rules
- AC 15: Performance < 10 seconds

✅ **Quality:**
- AC 13: Unit tests required
- AC 14: Integration tests required
- AC 16: Regression tests required

**2. Excellent Dependency Documentation**

```markdown
## Previous Story Context (Story 2.7 Completion)

Story 2.8 **reuses 90% of Story 2.7's infrastructure**:
- Storage Repository: Same upload pattern
- Progress Tracking: Same @Published properties
- Optimistic UI: Same message append pattern

**Key Differences:**
| Component | Story 2.7 | Story 2.8 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Picker    | UIImagePickerController | UIDocumentPickerViewController |
| Viewer    | Full-screen | QuickLook |
| Size Limit | 2MB | 10MB |
```

**Why this works:**
- Developer knows what to reuse (90%)
- Developer knows what's different (10%)
- Prevents duplicate implementation
- Maintains consistency

**3. Comprehensive Dev Notes with Sources**

Every technical detail includes source reference:

```markdown
### Data Models

[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#MessageAttachment]

struct MessageAttachment {
    let fileName: String?  // REQUIRED for documents
}
```

**Why this works:**
- Developer can verify information
- Developer can deep-dive if needed
- Maintains documentation integrity
- Easy to update when architecture changes

**4. Task 0: Check Existing Implementation**

```markdown
### Task 0: Check Existing Implementation [CRITICAL - Do First]
- [ ] Search protocol for uploadMessageDocument
- [ ] Check FirebaseStorageRepository for document upload
- [ ] Verify ChatViewModel has document picker state
- [ ] If 80%+ exists: Skip to missing pieces only
```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents duplicate work (learned from Story 2.5)
- Saves 4-6 hours of wasted effort
- Encourages code reuse
- Maintains consistency

**5. Tiered Testing Strategy**

```markdown
# Story-level tests (5-10 seconds)
./scripts/test-story.sh ChatViewModelDocumentTests

# Epic-level tests (20-40 seconds) - before marking complete
./scripts/test-epic.sh 2

# Full regression (1-2 minutes) - before commit
./scripts/quick-test.sh
```

**Why this works:**
- Fast feedback during development
- Epic integration verification
- Full regression before commit
- Clear when to use each tier

## PO Review Process

### Step 1: Initial Assessment (2 minutes)

Quick scan for red flags:
- [ ] Story statement exists and follows format
- [ ] Acceptance criteria section present
- [ ] Dev Notes section present
- [ ] Tasks section present
- [ ] Testing requirements specified

**Red flag:** If any section missing, REJECT immediately.

### Step 2: Acceptance Criteria Review (5 minutes)

Count and categorize ACs:
- [ ] 10-20 acceptance criteria (ideal)
- [ ] Mix of functional, non-functional, quality
- [ ] All criteria testable (can write test for it)
- [ ] All criteria measurable (pass/fail is clear)
- [ ] Regression testing included

**Red flag:** If < 8 ACs, story likely incomplete. If > 25, story might be too large.

### Step 3: Technical Completeness (5 minutes)

Check Dev Notes:
- [ ] Data models specified
- [ ] API specifications documented
- [ ] File locations provided
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] All references include sources

**Red flag:** If Dev Notes says "TBD" or "To be determined", story not ready.

### Step 4: Dependency Verification (3 minutes)

Check dependencies:
- [ ] Dependencies on previous stories stated
- [ ] Infrastructure reuse documented
- [ ] Key differences explained
- [ ] Task 0: Check existing implementation

**Red flag:** If builds on previous story but doesn't mention reuse, likely missing context.

### Step 5: Testing Adequacy (3 minutes)

Verify testing strategy:
- [ ] Unit tests specified
- [ ] Integration tests specified
- [ ] Performance tests with benchmarks
- [ ] Regression tests required
- [ ] Testing commands provided

**Red flag:** If testing section says "Write tests", story lacks specificity.

### Step 6: Scope Appropriateness (2 minutes)

Evaluate scope:
- [ ] Story accomplishes single feature
- [ ] Estimated 2-6 hours for implementation
- [ ] No "and also" requirements (indicates scope creep)
- [ ] MVP scope (complex features deferred)

**Red flag:** If story has 30+ tasks or > 8 hour estimate, consider splitting.
