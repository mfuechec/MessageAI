# Memory: Epic 3 Approval Session - 2025-10-22

## Key Decisions

### Epic 3 Scope Approved
- **Timeline:** 2-4 days (NOT 10-12 days as initially estimated)
- **Stories:** 7 stories (3.1 - 3.7)
- **Story 3.0 (Organization/Workspace System):** DEFERRED TO EPIC 4

### Timeline Expectations & Proven Velocity
- **Historical Performance:** Epic 1 and Epic 2 completed in <1.5 days each
- **User's actual velocity:** Much faster than standard 8-hour day estimates
- **Lesson Learned:** Conservative hour-based estimates don't match this user's proven velocity
- **Epic 3 Realistic Timeline:** 2-4 days based on proven performance

### Story 3.0 Deferral Rationale
- **What it is:** Organization/Workspace multi-tenancy system (like Slack workspaces)
- **Purpose:** Scope user directory to organization, prevent getAllUsers() scaling issues
- **Why deferred:**
  - Not required for AI features to function
  - Current user system works for MVP/small-medium teams
  - Reduces Epic 3 complexity and risk
  - Better suited for Epic 4 (Scaling & Enterprise Infrastructure theme)
- **Documented in:** `docs/epic-4-planning-notes.md`

### Budget & Procurement
- **Budget:** Confirmed (no specific cap mentioned, but approved)
- **Procurement:** User handles Firebase Blaze plan and OpenAI API key setup
- **No delays expected:** User confirmed procurement won't block epic start

### Quality Constraints (CRITICAL)
- **Story 3.7 CANNOT FAIL:** Quality validation thresholds are mandatory, not aspirational
- **Incremental validation required:** Stories 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 MUST each test with 3+ sample conversations before marking complete
- **Do not defer all validation to Story 3.7:** Validate quality early and often
- **LLM selection:** Use best-in-class (OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- **Prompt engineering:** Must be robust from day 1

### Quality Thresholds (Story 3.7)
- 8/10 summaries must capture all key decisions
- 7/10 conversations must have 80%+ action item detection
- 9/10 search queries must return relevant results in top 3

## Revised Epic 3 Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (0.5-1 day)
- Story 3.1: Cloud Functions Infrastructure for AI Services
- Story 3.5: AI Service Selection & Configuration

### Phase 2: Core AI Features (1-1.5 days, parallelizable)
- Story 3.2: Thread Summarization Feature
- Story 3.3: Action Item Extraction Feature
- Story 3.4: Smart Search Feature
- **Each must validate quality with 3+ test conversations before completion**

### Phase 3: Optimization & Quality (0.5-1 day)
- Story 3.6: AI Results Caching & Cost Optimization
- Story 3.7: AI Integration Testing & Quality Validation (CANNOT FAIL)

## PO Approval Workflow Insights

### What Triggered Pushback
- Initial estimate of 10-12 days seemed excessive
- User immediately referenced historical performance (Epic 1 & 2 in <1.5 days each)
- Conservative hour-based estimates didn't account for proven velocity

### What User Values
- **Speed:** Proven track record of fast delivery
- **Realism:** Timeline estimates should match historical performance
- **Quality non-negotiable:** Story 3.7 cannot fail - quality is mandatory
- **Pragmatic scope decisions:** Willing to defer infrastructure (Story 3.0) to deliver value faster

### Approval Process
1. User challenged timeline estimate (correct instinct)
2. Confirmed budget (no detailed discussion needed)
3. Clarified Story 3.0 purpose → agreed to defer to Epic 4
4. Confirmed procurement handled (no delays)
5. Emphasized Story 3.7 cannot fail → PO added incremental validation requirements

## Next Steps (as of session end)
1. ✅ Epic 3 scope approved and updated in `docs/epic-3-scope.md`
2. ✅ Story 3.0 documented in `docs/epic-4-planning-notes.md`
3. User to complete procurement (Firebase Blaze, OpenAI API)
4. Bob (SM) to draft Story 3.1 (Cloud Functions Infrastructure)
5. Begin Phase 1 development

## Files Modified
- `docs/epic-3-scope.md` - Updated with approved changes
- `docs/epic-4-planning-notes.md` - Created to capture Story 3.0 for Epic 4

## Key Takeaways for Future Sessions
- **Trust user's velocity estimates** - They've proven Epic 1 & 2 performance
- **Quality thresholds are mandatory** - When user says "cannot fail", add safeguards
- **Incremental validation >> final validation** - Don't defer all testing to final story
- **Pragmatic scope management** - User willing to defer infrastructure for faster value delivery
- **Procurement not a blocker** - User handles external dependencies efficiently
